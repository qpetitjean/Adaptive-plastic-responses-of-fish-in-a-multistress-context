This repository contains the data and scripts used to test the plastic responses of fish (_Gobio Occitaniae_) under metal-contaminated streams and immune challenge. These results are discussed in the following manuscript: 

Petitjean Q., Laffaille P., Perrault A., Cousseau M., Jean S., Jacquin L. Adaptive plastic responses to metal contamination in a multistress context: a field experiment in fish.

## Content

**The Dataset** folder contains a .csv file corresponding to the dataset used in this study and a .txt file containing the name and the signification of each columns of the dataset.

**The Rscript** folder contains 3 .R files:
- The first one (SourcePlots_PlasticResponsesFishMS.R) corresponding to the custom functions sourced to draw the figures included within the manuscript. 
- The second file (SourceTables_PlasticResponsesFishMS.R) corresponding to the custom functions sourced to draw the tables of summary statistics (Table 3 and 4) included within the manuscript. 
- And the third file (Rscript_PlasticResponsesFishMS.R) corresponding to the Rscript containing all the analyses performed in this study.

**The Report** folder contains the Rmarkdown files (HTML and MD version) of the statistical analyses conducted for this study (this is an equivalent to Rscript_PlasticResponsesFishMS.R but with the result of each command line displayed).
